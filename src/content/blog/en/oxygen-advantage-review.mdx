# Oxygen Advantage: The Counterintuitive Approach to Better Breathing

While most breathwork methods focus on breathing more, Patrick McKeown's Oxygen Advantage takes the opposite approach: breathe less, breathe better. This comprehensive review explores the method, its science, and how it compares to other popular techniques.

## Who Is Patrick McKeown?

Patrick McKeown is an Irish author and breathing educator who:

- Trained directly with Dr. Konstantin Buteyko (creator of the Buteyko Method)
- Authored multiple books including "The Oxygen Advantage" and "Atomic Focus"
- Works with elite athletes, military personnel, and corporate clients
- Developed the BOLT (Body Oxygen Level Test) score

His approach bridges traditional Buteyko breathing with sports science and modern research.

## The Core Philosophy

### The Paradox: Less Is More

Most people assume that breathing more means more oxygen. McKeown argues the opposite:

**Chronic over-breathing leads to:**
- Lower CO2 levels in the blood
- Reduced oxygen delivery to tissues (Bohr effect)
- Constricted blood vessels and airways
- Increased stress response

**Breathing less leads to:**
- Higher CO2 tolerance
- Better oxygen delivery
- Dilated blood vessels
- Calmer nervous system

This is why you can feel breathless even when your blood oxygen is at 99%.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The BOLT Score

BOLT (Body Oxygen Level Test) measures CO2 tolerance:

**How to measure:**
1. Breathe normally through your nose
2. After a normal exhale, pinch your nose
3. Time how long until you feel the first urge to breathe
4. This is NOT a maximum breath hold

**Interpreting your score:**
- Below 10 seconds: Poor tolerance, likely over-breather
- 10-20 seconds: Room for improvement
- 20-30 seconds: Good baseline
- 30-40 seconds: Very good
- Above 40 seconds: Excellent (elite athlete level)

### 2. Nasal Breathing Always

McKeown is emphatic: breathe through your nose 24/7, including during sleep and exercise.

**Why nose breathing matters:**
- Filters, warms, and humidifies air
- Produces nitric oxide
- Regulates breathing volume
- Activates the diaphragm properly

### 3. Light Breathing

The goal is to breathe so gently that:
- You can't hear yourself breathe
- You can barely feel air entering your nostrils
- Your breathing is slow and rhythmic

This trains CO2 tolerance and reduces chronic hyperventilation.

## The Oxygen Advantage Exercises

### Exercise 1: Breathe Light to Breathe Right

**Purpose:** Reduce breathing volume

**How to do it:**
1. Sit comfortably, relax
2. Breathe through your nose
3. Gradually reduce the size of each breath
4. Create a tolerable feeling of air hunger
5. Maintain for 3-5 minutes

**When to use:** Morning routine, before bed, during stress

### Exercise 2: Nose Unblocking Exercise

**Purpose:** Clear congestion, open airways

**How to do it:**
1. Take a small breath through your nose
2. Pinch your nose and hold your breath
3. Walk around while holding (20-30 steps)
4. When you need to breathe, release and breathe calmly through nose
5. Wait 30 seconds, repeat 5-6 times

**When to use:** When congested, before exercise

### Exercise 3: Breath Hold Walking

**Purpose:** Build CO2 tolerance, improve athletic performance

**How to do it:**
1. Walk at a normal pace
2. After a normal exhale, hold your breath
3. Continue walking while holding
4. When you feel a medium-to-strong air hunger, resume nasal breathing
5. Recover, repeat

**When to use:** Training sessions, building tolerance

### Exercise 4: Simulate High Altitude Training

**Purpose:** Trigger EPO release, improve oxygen-carrying capacity

**How to do it:**
1. Exhale normally, hold breath
2. Walk as many steps as possible (aim for 80-100)
3. You should feel strong air hunger
4. Recover fully between sets
5. Do 8-10 sets

**When to use:** Athletic performance enhancement

## Comparing Methods

### Oxygen Advantage vs. Wim Hof

| Aspect | Oxygen Advantage | Wim Hof |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Breathing volume | Less is more | More then hold |
| CO2 approach | Build tolerance | Temporarily deplete |
| Primary effect | Parasympathetic | Sympathetic first |
| Intensity | Gentle, subtle | Intense, energizing |
| Best for | Daily life, athletics | Energy, cold tolerance |
| Risk level | Very low | Moderate (if done wrong) |

**Can they work together?** Yes. Many practitioners use:
- Oxygen Advantage principles for daily life
- Wim Hof for specific activation/cold exposure

### Oxygen Advantage vs. Box Breathing

| Aspect | Oxygen Advantage | Box Breathing |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Breath holds | Long, building | Short, equal |
| Goal | CO2 tolerance | Calm, balance |
| Complexity | Multiple exercises | Single technique |
| Time needed | Varies | 4-5 minutes |
| Best for | Long-term adaptation | Acute stress relief |

## Who Benefits Most?

### Athletes

McKeown works extensively with athletes. Benefits include:

- Improved VO2 max
- Better anaerobic threshold
- Reduced exercise-induced asthma
- Enhanced recovery

**Notable users:** UFC fighters, Olympic athletes, professional soccer players

### People with Breathing Issues

- Asthma (many report reduced symptoms)
- Sleep apnea
- Chronic mouth breathers
- Anxiety-related breathing dysfunction

### Everyday Optimization

- Better sleep quality
- Reduced stress response
- Improved focus
- More energy throughout the day

## Criticisms and Limitations

**Fair criticisms:**

1. **Less exciting** - Compared to Wim Hof, it's subtle and takes patience
2. **Hard to verify** - Some claims are difficult to test rigorously
3. **Not for everyone** - Some conditions may not respond
4. **Requires consistency** - Results come slowly

**Unfair criticisms:**

1. "It's just breathing less" - It's a comprehensive system
2. "CO2 is waste" - CO2 is a vital regulator of oxygen delivery

## Getting Started

### Week 1: Awareness

1. Measure your BOLT score daily
2. Notice when you mouth breathe
3. Start gentle nasal breathing focus

### Week 2: Light Breathing

1. Practice "breathe light" 10 minutes/day
2. Tape mouth during sleep (if appropriate)
3. Continue BOLT measurements

### Week 3-4: Integration

1. Add breath hold walking
2. Nasal breathe during easy exercise
3. Track BOLT improvements

### Month 2+: Advanced

1. Simulate altitude training
2. Nasal breathing during harder exercise
3. Target BOLT score above 30

## Resources

**Books:**
- "The Oxygen Advantage" (main text)
- "Atomic Focus" (focus-oriented)
- "The Breathing Cure" (health focus)

**Online:**
- OxygenAdvantage.com
- Certified instructor directory

## The Bottom Line

Oxygen Advantage isn't as flashy as some breathwork methods, but it may be the most practical for daily life improvement. The principles—nose breathing, light breathing, CO2 tolerance—can transform how you feel all day, every day.

**Best for:**
- Long-term health optimization
- Athletic performance
- People who've tried "more breathing" without results

**Rating: 4.5/5**
