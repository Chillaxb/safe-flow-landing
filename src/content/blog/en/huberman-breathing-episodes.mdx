![Important context: Huberman's actual expertise is vision neuroscience, not breathing. With $5-10M/year in podcast revenue and recurring sponsors (AG1, LMNT), his content is excellent popularization but should not replace peer-reviewed literature](/images/blog/huberman-brain-science.png)

## Note on Andrew Huberman Himself

### Profile

- **Position:** Associate Professor of Neurobiology at Stanford
- **Publications:** ~100 peer-reviewed articles (on vision, not breathing)
- **H-index:** ~40 (respectable)
- **Actual specialty:** Neuroscience of vision and visual circuits

### Strengths
- Excellent science communicator
- Generally cites his sources
- Long format allows for nuance

### Conflicts of Interest to Know
- **Recurring sponsors:** AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker, Momentous
- **Estimated revenue:** $5-10M/year via the podcast
- Some sponsors sell products with contested efficacy

### Questionable Points
- His specialty is **vision**, not breathing—he popularizes others' work
- Sometimes accused of simplifying or over-interpreting studies
- Protocols presented as "science-based" are sometimes extrapolations
- Doesn't always mention when a study is preliminary or on animals

---

## Conclusion

The Huberman Lab is an excellent science communication resource, but **it's not scientific literature**.

**Rules for using these episodes well:**

1. **Do:** Verify cited sources before applying
2. **Do:** Prefer episodes with academic guests (Feldman, Spiegel, Epel)
3. **Caution:** Be vigilant with guests who sell trainings
4. **Caution:** Distinguish inspiration from information
5. **Avoid:** Don't take a podcast as medical reference
