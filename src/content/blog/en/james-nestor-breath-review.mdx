# James Nestor's "Breath": The Book That Changed Everything

When James Nestor's "Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art" hit shelves in 2020, it became an instant bestseller and sparked a global conversation about something we do 25,000 times a day without thinking. Here's what makes this book essential reading and how to apply its lessons.

## The Book at a Glance

**Author**: James Nestor, science journalist
**Published**: 2020
**Pages**: 304
**Key Thesis**: Modern humans have forgotten how to breathe properly, and this is causing widespread health problems

## The Stanford Experiment

The book opens with Nestor's participation in a Stanford study where he deliberately mouth-breathed for 10 days, then nose-breathed for 10 days. The results were striking:

**Mouth Breathing Phase:**
- Blood pressure increased by 13 points
- Heart rate variability dropped
- Snoring increased 4,820%
- Sleep apnea events appeared
- Cognitive performance declined
- Stress levels elevated

**Nose Breathing Phase:**
- All metrics returned to baseline or improved
- Snoring nearly eliminated
- Sleep quality dramatically improved
- Energy levels increased

This self-experiment sets the tone for the book: breathing isn't just important—it's foundational.

## Key Concepts from the Book

### 1. We've Devolved

Nestor presents evidence that human skulls have changed over the past few hundred years:

- Jaws have become smaller
- Airways have narrowed
- Crooked teeth became common
- Mouth breathing became normalized

**The culprit?** Soft, processed foods that don't require chewing, leading to underdeveloped jaw muscles and facial structures.

### 2. Nose Breathing Is Non-Negotiable

The nose is not just a passive air passage. It:

- Filters pathogens and particles
- Humidifies incoming air
- Warms air to body temperature
- Produces nitric oxide (a vasodilator)
- Regulates breathing rate

Nestor argues that mouth breathing should be reserved for emergencies and intense exercise—not everyday life.

### 3. Slow Down

Modern humans breathe too fast. The optimal rate, according to research Nestor cites:

- **5.5 seconds inhale**
- **5.5 seconds exhale**
- **5.5 breaths per minute**

This "perfect breath" maximizes heart rate variability and oxygen delivery.

### 4. Exhale More

Many of us are "over-breathers"—taking in more air than we need. This leads to:

- CO2 depletion
- Reduced oxygen delivery (Bohr effect)
- Anxiety and stress

The solution: focus on complete exhales and don't rush to inhale.

### 5. Chew More

One of the book's more surprising recommendations: chewing hard foods (or gum) can help maintain jaw structure and airway health. Nestor even experiments with mastic gum for hours daily.

## Practical Protocols from the Book

### The Tape Test

Nestor famously mouth-taped during sleep throughout his research. Benefits reported:

- Reduced snoring
- Better sleep quality
- Improved morning energy

**How to try it:**
1. Use surgical tape or specialized mouth tape
2. Start with short periods while awake
3. Ensure you can still breathe through nose
4. Try for short naps before full nights

### Breath Counting

A simple awareness exercise:

1. Breathe normally for 1 minute
2. Count your breaths
3. Ideal: 5-8 breaths per minute
4. If higher, consciously slow down

### Extended Exhale Practice

From the "perfect breath" research:

1. Inhale slowly for 5.5 seconds
2. Exhale slowly for 5.5 seconds
3. Practice for 5-10 minutes
4. Aim for this to become your default pattern

## Characters and Stories

One of the book's strengths is its storytelling. Memorable figures include:

**Carl Stough** - A choir conductor who taught emphysema patients to breathe better, achieving remarkable results that puzzled doctors.

**Katharina Schroth** - Developed breathing exercises for scoliosis patients that are still used today.

**The Framingham Study** - Lung capacity was found to be the greatest predictor of longevity—more than genetics, diet, or exercise.

**The Buteyko Practitioners** - Russian doctors who developed techniques for breathing less, not more.

## Criticisms and Limitations

No book is perfect. Some valid criticisms:

1. **Anecdotal evidence** - Some claims rely heavily on individual stories rather than large studies

2. **Self-experimentation** - n=1 studies, while interesting, aren't scientifically rigorous

3. **Oversimplification** - Complex health conditions are sometimes attributed solely to breathing

4. **Cherry-picking** - Critics argue Nestor selects studies that support his thesis while ignoring contradictory evidence

Despite these limitations, the core message—pay attention to how you breathe—is well-supported by mainstream science.

## How This Book Changed My Practice

Reading "Breath" led me to:

1. **Tape my mouth at night** - Took getting used to, but improved sleep quality
2. **Check my breathing rate** - I was averaging 12-15 breaths/minute; now closer to 6
3. **Prioritize nose breathing** - Even during moderate exercise
4. **Practice daily breathwork** - 10 minutes of slow breathing became non-negotiable

## Who Should Read This Book?

**Definitely read if you:**
- Snore or have sleep issues
- Breathe through your mouth habitually
- Experience chronic stress or anxiety
- Are interested in the science of breathing
- Want practical health improvements

**Maybe skip if you:**
- Are looking for a quick how-to guide
- Don't enjoy narrative non-fiction
- Want peer-reviewed studies only

## Key Quotes

> "No matter what we eat, how much we exercise, how resilient our genes are, how skinny or young or wise we are—none of it will matter unless we're breathing correctly."

> "The perfect breath is this: Breathe in for about 5.5 seconds, then exhale for 5.5 seconds. That's 5.5 breaths a minute for a total of about 5.5 liters of air."

> "Nose breathing is far more efficient and works with our bodies' natural design."

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.5/5**

"Breath" isn't a peer-reviewed paper—it's a journalist's exploration of a fascinating subject. It's engaging, well-researched within its genre, and most importantly, it can genuinely improve your life if you apply its lessons.

The book's greatest contribution is making people *aware* of their breathing. That awareness alone is transformative.

## Action Items After Reading

1. **Audit your breathing** - Are you a mouth or nose breather?
2. **Count your breath rate** - Is it above 10/minute?
3. **Try the 5.5-5.5 pattern** - Can you maintain it?
4. **Consider mouth taping** - Start with short tests
5. **Establish a daily practice** - Even 5 minutes matters
