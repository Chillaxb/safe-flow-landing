## Videos to Avoid

![Red flags to avoid: "10 rounds challenge" (syncope risk), underwater practice (DEADLY), disease cure claims (pseudoscience). The Wim Hof empire: app $10/month, courses up to $7000—free YouTube content is a conversion funnel but still valuable](/images/blog/wim-hof-danger-warning.png)

### Red Flags

| Video Type | Why to Avoid |
|------------|--------------|
| "10 rounds Wim Hof Challenge" | Dangerous, risk of syncope |
| "Wim Hof underwater" | **DEADLY** - several documented deaths |
| "Cure [disease] with Wim Hof" | Dangerous medical clickbait |
| Without safety warnings | Irresponsible creator |
| With "miracle" claims | Pseudoscience |

### Deaths Associated with the Method

**Important:** At least 4 deaths have been officially linked to Wim Hof practice, all involving water (hyperventilation followed by syncope in water). **NEVER practice in or near water.**

## Note on the Wim Hof Empire

### Conflicts of Interest on the Official Channel

| Product | Price | Comment |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Wim Hof App | $10/month or $60/year | Features similar to free YouTube |
| Fundamentals Course | $279 | Online video course |
| Classic 10-Week Course | $549 | More in-depth content |
| In-person workshops | $200-500 | Sessions with certified instructors |
| Instructor certifications | $2000-7000 | To become an instructor |

**The "free" YouTube videos are conversion funnels** to these paid products. The content is still useful, but keep this context in mind.

### Free vs. Paid

| Available for free on YouTube | Exclusive to paid app/courses |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Basic technique | Multi-week structured programs |
| Guided sessions (3-4 rounds) | Progress tracking |
| Cold exposure (basics) | Advanced techniques |
| | Exclusive Wim content |
| | Certifications |

**Verdict:** For most people, YouTube + personal discipline is enough. The app/courses are "nice to have," not essential.
